# HooBank

A modern, responsive banking/finance UI template — "HooBank".

This README explains what the project is, how to run it locally, how to customize it, and how to contribute. If you share the repository's exact tech stack (for example: React, Next.js, Vite, plain HTML/CSS/JS, Tailwind, etc.) I will update this README with precise commands and examples.

## What is HooBank
HooBank is a clean and modern UI template built for banking and fintech web applications. It typically includes responsive layouts, card components, navigation, hero sections, and other UI elements designed for demo or starter projects.

## Features (possible)
- Responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Modern UI components (cards, buttons, navbar, footer)
- Reusable components and utility classes
- Easy customization of colors, fonts, and assets
- Demo pages such as Home, Services, Contact (if included)

## Demo
If you have a deployed demo (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, etc.), add the link here:
- Demo: https://example.com

## Screenshots
Add preview images from the repository or /public folder:
- screenshots/screenshot-1.png
- screenshots/screenshot-2.png

## Requirements
- If this is a Node-based project:
  - Node.js (recommended >= 14)
  - npm or yarn
- If this is a static project: any modern web browser is enough.

## Installation and local development
Below are common steps. Replace commands according to the actual stack used in the repository.

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pradeepinform12/HooBank.git
cd HooBank
```

2. Install dependencies (if applicable)
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

3. Start the development server
Common script names:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
npm start
# or for create-react-app:
npm start
# or for vite:
npm run dev
```

4. Build for production
```bash
npm run build
# preview production build (if supported)
npm run preview
```

If the project contains only static files, you can serve them locally with a simple server, for example:
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

## Project structure (typical)
- public/ — static files (images, favicon)
- src/ — source code (components, pages, styles)
- src/assets/ — images and icons
- src/components/ — reusable UI components
- package.json — scripts and dependencies
- README.md — this file

Adjust this section to match the repository's actual structure.

## Customization
- Colors: edit CSS files or Tailwind config (if Tailwind is used)
- Fonts: update index.html or global styles to include Google Fonts or local fonts
- Images: replace files in public/assets or src/assets

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome. Suggested workflow:
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch: git checkout -b feature/your-feature
3. Make changes and commit with clear messages
4. Push branch and open a pull request

Please include a clear description of changes and, if relevant, screenshots and testing steps.

## License
Check if there's an existing LICENSE file. If not, consider adding an open-source license such as the MIT License.

What I did: I converted the earlier Hindi-style README into a clear, concise English README and provided a template that fits most UI template repositories.

What's next: If you give me the repository's exact tech stack or share files like package.json or the src folder layout, I will update this README with exact installation commands, available scripts, sample screenshots, and any demo link so the README matches the project precisely.
